# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, Telegram or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please check the [ROADMAP file](https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture/blob/master/README.MD) before raising an issue. There's a chance that the missing feature you
are expecting is already in our TODO list. We will get there soon.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Join the telegram channel at: https://t.me/eyeon_social if you have any queries, suggestions etc.

## General rules

1. Commits must be atomic. They should reflect a set of distinct changes as a single operation
   that solve one problem at a time.
2. Commit messages must be meaningful, clear and concise. Stress on your grammar, it's fine to 
   google the correct way to say something, English isn't everyone's first language.
3. Commits should do exactly what their message says. If a commit affects quite a few files, and 
   does a few related things, mention them in the commit description. Refrain from using `git commit -m` in such cases.
4. IDE config files/temp files are not meant to be a part of the repository and they should remain so.
5. Variable names like `a`, `x`, `foo` are unacceptable.
   
## Pull Request Process

1. Check if there's already a PR assigned to someone that solves a similar problem to yours.
2. Ensure that the pull request is being sent from a hotfix/feature branch and not from `master`.
3. Check the issue page if the feature you are trying to add/bug you are trying to fix is already in
   the list. If it does, mention the issue number in parentheses with the pull request.
4. Provide a clear, concise description of why this pull request is necessary and what value it adds.
   Make sure that your PR doesn't contain any more or less than what the PR description says.
5. One PR should do only one thing only. No more, no less. If you want to implement two new features,
   open two PRs.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at https://t.me/eyeon_social. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
