# Fixture

**Fixture** is a no-bullshit, free and open source raster graphics editor.

## Motivation

**Fixture** is an attempt to be a multiplatform, free and open source replacement for Adobe Photoshop. This aims to solve the need for having a proper raster graphics editor with a clean and focused UI, to help graphic artists and regular users morph or create images quickly, even on a Linux distribution.

Fixture, as of now is a work in progress. The master branch has the latest compilable but not necessary the most stable version. To grab a copy of Fixture, simply clone the repository.
